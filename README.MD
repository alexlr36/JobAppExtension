Purpose:
Finding jobs and applying sucks. I have to filter through several applications to find which ones im both interested in and qualify for. 
Therefore, i'd like to automate this as much as possible. Ideally this will be done in the three parts described below. It's seperated into these
since they are what i belive will take the longest to figure out(with part to most likely expanding into more subsections.)

pt1(done)
When on linkedIn and on the jobs page. 
get to 20 applications, save them locally, with descriptions and links
(keep these saved to write follow up letters for each of them)

pt1.5
i/user then parses them and keeps or removes some.

pt2.
(fun/harder part)
Extension then goes to these sites one by one and attempts to apply to each

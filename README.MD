-Purpose:
Finding jobs and applying sucks. I have to filter through several applications to find which ones im both interested in and qualify for. 
Therefore, i'd like to automate this as much as possible. Ideally this will be done in the three parts described below. It's seperated into these
since they are what i belive will take the longest to figure out(with part two most likely expanding into more subsections.)

--pt1(done)
When on linkedIn and on the jobs page. 
get to 20 applications, save them locally, with descriptions and links
(keep these saved to write follow up letters for each of them)

--pt1.5(done -- styling is a bit strange however)
i/user then parses them and keeps or removes some.

--pt2.
(fun/harder part)
Extension then goes to these sites one by one and attempts to apply to each
    -- pt 2.1
        Go to site, based on which site it is, fill out its information
        The following sites are generic enough that they can go ahead and be autofilled, and possibly submitted
         - https://boards.greenhouse.io



Extras:

- Attach cover letter. If CV is generic, make extension replace [company name] with current company applying for.
- Run 1-2 times a day. This will make it so it is now completley automated as well as runs so little as to not get flagged from lknin
